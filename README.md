# discord-cogs
##### Free to use Discord Cogs using discord.py
As a disclaimer, the cogs here should be looked at as skeletons. There are many more things you can do with them and more efficient ways to do some things. When I first started using discord.py, cogs were foreign and took a while to grasp. The hope is that you can use and change the ones here to further understand how they work.

##### Before getting started
If you havent already, take a look at the [discord.py documentation](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and if you dont know what cogs are within discord.py you can take a look [here](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ext/commands/cogs.html).
